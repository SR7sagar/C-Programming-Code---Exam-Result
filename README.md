---------------- C PROGRAMMING CODE -------------------------

Hello! Welcome to my First C-Programming Code. This code is my final year project which is based on making the results for students studying in my college. So, the result format is supported
based on my college and matches most of the college in my region (Nepal, South East Asia).

Description of Code:
- There are only 5 Subjects based on my college so the code will ask input for 5 subjects.
- First, it asks for the number of students you want to put the detail.
- After entering the number of students then it will ask for the details of students.
- Then it will ask for Class, Roll no and so on information of that student.
- It will then ask for the marks of the student based on the 5 subjects.
  Note! The marks of the student cannot be minus or more than 100. If it exceeds the limit then it will ask to re-write the marks value again. Also, it cannot be character.
- Then it will calculate the marks and gives you the result.
- After that if you choose option 2 then it will show the recent result of the student.
- And if you chose the option 3 then it will show all the result of the student.
- Option 4 will ask you the name of the student and gives you result based on the name. 
- Option 5 will exit the program. Also you cannot chose any other option except from 1-5 if you do then it will give you error.

I hope someone might need this code sometime in future and will be helpful.
Thank you.
